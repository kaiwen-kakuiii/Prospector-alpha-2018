# Prospector-alpha-2018
Notes:
1. Carefully read all the comments will save you a lot of time!
2. run_prospector.py is designed for using multithread to fit a large sample.
3. func.py has some functions like component (disintangle flux into different mechnism).
4. When you draw from a results file, make sure using the same prospector model when you ran the MCMC.
