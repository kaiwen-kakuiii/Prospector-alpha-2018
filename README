# Prospector-alpha-2018
Notes:
1. run_prospector.py is designed for using multithread to fit a large sample.
2. func.py has some functions like component (disintangle flux into different mechnism).
3. When you draw from a results file, make sure using the same prospector model when you ran the MCMC.
